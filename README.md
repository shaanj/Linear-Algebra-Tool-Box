# Plans-for-Sophomore-Year

9/8/2020 - 9/9/2020 (Past Midnight), "Never More" Persona 4 Reincarnation, sophomore year, Shaan Jalal


My name is Shaan Farhan Jalal. I am 19 years old. The First week of my 2020 fall semester (remote from COVID-19), has just passed and I find myself reverting back to my old habits now that I'm cooped up in my house without much human interaction void the interaction from family. My name is Shaan Farhan Jalal. I am a computer science major at Rutgers University, class of 2023. I'm willing to put in all the hours to learn all that I need to learn to receive my degree, earn a job, but much more than that, I am continuing to learn for the sake of knowledge, and becoming a better human being and better man with every passing day. My first year here was rough, with anyone's freshman fall semester being hell, and the spring semester being hindered by the advent of COVID-19 forcing us all to go back home for an undetermined amount of time. The following list represents the hopes, goals, and standards that I expect to uphold for myself during 2020-2021. This is not a hard list of things to follow, but by no means is it meant to be easy. This list is designed to get me out of my comfort zone, and get me farther in life. I present to myself, Shaan Farhan Jalal, never more shall I be the same...



USACS/CS at Rutgers
- Participate at more USACS events, actively seek out events and make a calendar for your time and events.
- Hit Up Archi, Rahul, Sam, Srija, Maanya, and others to see how they're doing, strengthen your friendships and demonstrate capability by showing interest and emotional depth into their problems/struggles, all while making yourself seem like someone who nevers stops improving themselves.
- Appeal to upperclassmen in terms of learning how to become a better teacher by studying their teaching methods, and seeing what can be cultivated into my own methods of teaching and explaining concepts to myself and when I have to explain them to someone else.
- Appeal to underclassmen in terms of seeing how they respond to my teaching methods, seeing if I go too fast, too slow, am ambiguous, or simply they don't understand the concepts that I'm trying to explain. Learn to pace yourself while teaching, and NEVER EVER say that something is innately easy. Don't be a jerk, don't be an idiot.


Contact with everyone else
- Hit people up on Insta to let them know that you think and care about them, whatever college or wherever they may have ended up. (High school people)
- Catch up with people, and assure them that COVID will get better and that maybe during the period when safety guidelines and extreme regulations are lifted, offer to meet up if they wish.


Discord Bot
 - Coding a discord bot seems like a super cool project idea, where you can literally put anything into the discord bot, and you can always ask people associated with USACS with help in those regards.
 - Learning to make the bot will help in the long run by introducing you to new languages and build proficiencies with those languages.
  
  
Self Care
- No matter what you do, if your health is not your primary concern, you can't do whatever you want to do. Whether you plan on helping Ammu and Abbu outside doing backbreaking work, or spend several hours sitting in a chair doing calc 2, you need breaks and time to unwind.
- While you can never stop improving, you need to realize when too much is going on and is on your plate at any given time.
- Stop going to bed at like 3-4 AM. You don't gain anything from watching random videos at 3-4 AM, it makes you get up later, I could've spent that time better!
  
  
Writing
- Use the journal at your disposal or any other avenue of writing to build your writing skills and get your mind thinking and constantly producing content.
- Whether you write fiction, non fiction, analyze articles (probably not), or just write about your day, it's progress in the right direction.


Exercise
 - Dumbbells in your room can be used with the super large ottoman as a bench
 - Go out on Fridays, weekends, etc for walks around the neighborhood when you have free time, and don't have other preoccupations


Typing
- I think that you type too slowly, use the suggestions from Daniel Kim from your freshmen year and do typeracer when you have free time. Having a fast typing spped in useful in any given context given the path you're going in life, not to mention it means getting your work done in a faster fashion.


Music
- Listen to music that will motivate you.
- Don't listen to something if you don't genuinely like how it sounds.
- Preferably, listen to music from Main or the Persona 4 playlist you have on Youtube. Those songs were handpicked by a genius.


Cooking
- Study different recipes that you can make at home, and learn what individual ingredients do to contribute to the flavor profile, spiciness, texture etc.
- EAT: Execution, Appearance, Taste


Reddit
- Going to Reddit should be an experience to detox, see something interesting/relaxing, and learn if you have the chance by appreciating the merits of certain posts.
- Joining subreddits that I can learn from or genuinely find funny, thought-provoking, etc.
- Not meant to watch fits of violence, nothing to be gained from watching idiocy.


Gaming
- Very bottom of the list due to the unimportance of this particular goal for sophomore and for the 2020-2021 school year.
- Finish Persona 4 Golden, (For now).
- Playing Smash is therapeutic, CMV.


I know these won't happen overnight, but I guarantee you will persevere.
